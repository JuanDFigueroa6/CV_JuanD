Deployment checklist:

- Update contact email and phone in the footer if needed.
- Replace placeholder gallery images (assets/blog3.jpg) with final project thumbnails and update paths in portfolio-* pages.
- If you want to minify assets during build, run: npm install && npm run build (requires devDependencies installation).
- Configure hosting provider (Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages): set build command `npm run build` and publish folder `dist/`.
- (Optional) Add analytics script to `index.html` and other pages before building for production.
- (Optional) Add SSL configuration if your host requires special settings.
